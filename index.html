    <h1>Lynn Mueller | MinSun Oh</h1>
    <h2>Web Designer, Developer, Project Manager, Writer</h2>
    <p>I'm a Web Designer, Front End Developer, and Project Manager from Elgin, Illinois.<br /><br />
        I enjoy turning problems into simple and intuitive solutions.  I also enjoy writing and am the published author of two books and a newsletter.<br /><br />
        I specialize in project management and data management.<br /><br />
        I'm multilingual and multicultural.  With my international work experience, I bring diverse perspectives to the table, with a dedicated work ethic.<br />
        I've lived and worked in the US, China, and Korea.
        When I'm not pushing pixels, you'll find me riding my horse, playing with my cat, or learning Ruby.<br /><br />
